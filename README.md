## My process

### Built with

- Basic HTML and CSS

### What I learned

I learned how to use the `:not()` and `:first-child` psuedo-classes.

### Continued development

I want to optimize my website for accessibility and responsive design. I also want to make the width of the social links card be the same size as in the design.

### Useful resources

- [Grace Snow's Blog Post about Padding and Margin](https://fedmentor.dev/posts/padding-margin/) - Helped me understand basic information about margin and how to use it to space out HTML elements.
